Do not change directory name. The template files should thus be here now: /wp-content/themes/adventurous/index.php (for example).
3. Log into your WP admin panel and click on the Design tab. Now click on the Adventurous theme to activate it.
4. Complete all of the required inputs on the Adventurous Theme Options page (in the WP admin panel) and click "Save Changes".
